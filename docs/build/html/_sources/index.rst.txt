BE Python Tutorials Repository
============================================

This repository is your starting point for all the information you need as a CME student to learn Python (basic and advanced). The Python course material is oriented as good as possible towards students in Architectural Design, Construction, Engineering, Urban Planning, and Construction Management.

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Python is used intensively for various applications in the built environment. Hence, knowledge of Python is an invaluable asset for you as an engineer in the built environment of the future â€“ whether you are concerned with building data management, urban data science, device handling and IoT-based automation, machine learning and data analysis, or geospatial data management. In this course, you will learn the basics of Python (part 1) and you are introduced to a number of more advanced functionalities in a number of key areas of interest: buildings, IoT devices, & geospatial.
This repository and tutorial is part of the CME Master Program in TU/e (Construction Management and Engineering). It is not linked to one specific course. Its content is of use to:

- Fundamentals of BIM
