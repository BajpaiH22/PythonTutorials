# Scripting

## What is a Script?

If you quit Spyder (or another editor/IDE) and enter it again, the variables or functions that you defined in the console will be lost. However, you may want to store a particular sequence of commands for several reasons.

- You want to share the sequence with someone.
- You want to reuse the sequence later on.
- You want to continue working on the same process.

Fortunately, we can use scripting to store the sequence of commands for later use. In this way we can easily run the code again in one go. To illustrate, imagine you used a set of commands to clean a dataset and you would like to do exactly the same of a different set of data. You can run the script again for the new dataset without having to perform all the commands seperately again. Or maybe you want to help a peer student out to clean his dataset. You could simply send the script with this person.
