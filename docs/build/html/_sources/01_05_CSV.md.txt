# Working with CSV files

## In this tutorial

In this tutorial we will discuss how you can use Python to work with CSV files. We we show how to read the data from these files, perform edits or store our results to them.

## What is a CSV file

You might have worked with CSV files before, but it is important to realize how these files are build up. If you open a CSV file in Excel, you might not really notice a difference to .xls files. However, CSV files are unique in the sense that they are accesibile to almost any software package out there. The reason for this is that the file structure is very simple. If you open a CSV file in a simple text editor (e.g. notepad), you will notice that they consists of lines of information which is seperated by comma's, hence the name "Comma Seperated Values". Each line represents a data point and the values on that line is the information that we have on each case.
