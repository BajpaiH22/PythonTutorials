# Scripting

## What is a Script?

If you quit Spyder (or another editor/IDE) and enter it again, the variables or functions that you defined in the console will be lost. However, you may want to store a particular sequence of commands for several reasons.

- You want to share the sequence with someone.
- You want to reuse the sequence later on.
- You want to automate a process.

Fortunately, we can use scripting to store the sequence of commands for later use. In this way we can easily run the code again in one go. 

To illustrate, imagine you used a set of commands to clean a dataset with sensor data. Now that you finished cleaning the data from one sensor, you need to move on to other sensors. Since the data will likely show similar errors, cleaning both datasets will require similar procedures. Therefore it is usefull to store the steps that you took for the first dataset, so you can apply them again. This can safe you a lot of time! Alternatively, you might want to help a peer student out to clean his dataset. You could simply send the script you developed to this person and he/she will also be able to repeat your procedures.
